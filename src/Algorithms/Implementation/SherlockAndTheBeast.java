/**
 * Sherlock and The Beast
 *
 * Sherlock Holmes suspects his archenemy, Professor Moriarty,
 * is once again plotting something diabolical.
 * Sherlock's companion, Dr. Watson,
 * suggests Moriarty may be responsible for MI6's recent issues with their supercomputer, The Beast.
 *
 * Shortly after resolving to investigate,
 * Sherlock receives a note from Moriarty boasting about infecting The Beast with a virus;
 * however, he also gives him a clueâ€”a number, N.
 * Sherlock determines the key to removing the virus is to find the largest Decent Number having digits.
 *
 * A Decent Number has the following properties:
 * Its digits can only be 3's and/or 5's.
 * The number of 3's it contains is divisible by 5.
 * The number of 5's it contains is divisible by 3.
 * If there are more than one such number, we pick the largest one.
 * Moriarty's virus shows a clock counting down to The Beast's destruction, and time is running out fast.
 * Your task is to help Sherlock find the key before The Beast is destroyed!
 *
 * Constraints
 * Input Format
 * The first line is an integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.
 * The  subsequent lines each contain an integer, N, detailing the number of digits in the number.
 *
 * Output Format
 * Print the largest Decent Number having N digits; if no such number exists, tell Sherlock by printing -1.
 *
 * Sample Input
 * 4
 * 1
 * 3
 * 5
 * 11
 *
 * Sample Output
 * -1
 * 555
 * 33333
 * 55555533333
