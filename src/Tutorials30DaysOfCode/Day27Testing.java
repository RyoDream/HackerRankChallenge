/**
 * Day 27: Testing
 *
 * Objective
 * This challenge is very different from the others we've completed
 * because it requires you to generate valid test cases for a problem instead of solving the problem.
 *
 * There is no input to read, you simply have to generate
 * and print test values for the problem that satisfy both the problem's Input Format
 * and the criteria laid out in the Task section.
 *
 * Check out the Tutorial tab for an instructional video on testing!
 *
 * A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of N students.
 * Frustrated with their lack of discipline,
 * he decides to cancel class if fewer than K students are present when class starts.
 *
 * Given the arrival time of each student, determine if the class is canceled.
 * Input Format
 *
 * The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases.
 * Each test case consists of two lines.
 * The first line has two space-separated integers,
 * N (students in the class) and K (the cancelation threshold).
 * The second line contains N space-separated integers () describing the arrival times for each student.
 *
 * Note: Non-positive arrival times indicate the student arrived early or on time;
 * positive arrival times indicate the student arrived  minutes late.
 *
 * Output Format
 * For each test case, print the word YES if the class is canceled or NO if it is not.
 *
 * Constraints
 * 1 <= T <= 10
 * 1 <= N <= 1000
 * 1 <= K <= N
 * -100 <= ai <= 100, where iâˆˆ[1,N]
 *
 * Note
 * If a student arrives exactly on time,
 * the student is considered to have entered before the class started.
 *
 * Sample Input
 * 2
 * 4 3
 * -1 -3 4 2
 * 4 2
 * 0 -1 2 1
 *
 * Sample Output
 * YES
 * NO
