/**
 * Simple Text Editor
 *
 * In this challenge, you must implement a simple text editor.
 * Initially, your editor contains an empty string, S.
 * You must perform Q operations of the following  types:
 *      1. append(W) - Append string W to the end of S.
 *      2. delete(k) - Delete the last k characters of S.
 *      3. print(k) - Print the k character of S.
 *      4. undo() - Undo the last (not previously undone) operation of type 1 or 2,
 *                  reverting S to the state it was in prior to that operation.
 *
 * Input Format
 * The first line contains an integer, Q, denoting the number of operations.
 *
 * Each line i of the Q subsequent lines (where 0<=i<=Q) defines an operation to be performed.
 * Each operation starts with a single integer, t (where tâˆˆ{1,2,3,4}),
 * denoting a type of operation as defined in the Problem Statement above.
 * If the operation requires an argument, t is followed by its space-separated argument.
 * For example, if t=1 and W="abcd", line i will be 1 abcd.
 *
 * Constraints
 * 1 <= Q <= 10^5
 * 1 <= k <= |S|
 * The sum of the lengths of all  in the input .
 * All input characters are lowercase English letters.
 * It is guaranteed that the sequence of operations given as input is possible to perform.
 *
 * Output Format
 * Each operation of type 3 must print the kth character on a new line.
 *
 * Sample Input
 * 8
 * 1 abc
 * 3 3
 * 2 3
 * 1 xy
 * 3 2
 * 4
 * 4
 * 3 1
 *
 * Sample Output
 * c
 * y
 * a
