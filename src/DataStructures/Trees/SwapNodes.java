/**
 * Swap Nodes
 *
 * A binary tree is a tree which is characterized by any one of the following properties:
 * It can be an empty (null).
 * It contains a root node and two subtrees, left subtree and right subtree.
 * These subtrees are also binary tree.
 *
 * Inorder traversal is performed as
 * Traverse the left subtree.
 * Visit root (print it).
 * Traverse the right subtree.
 * (For an Inorder traversal, start from the root and keep visiting the left subtree recursively
 * until you reach the leaf,then you print the node at which you are and then you visit the right subtree.)
 *
 *
 * We define depth of a node as follow:
 * Root node is at depth 1.
 * If the depth of parent node is d, then the depth of current node wll be d+1.
 * Swapping: Swapping subtrees of a node means that if initially node has left subtree L and right subtree R,
 * then after swapping left subtree will be R and right subtree L.
 *
 * Eg. In the following tree, we swap children of node 1.
 * Depth
 *   1               1            [1]
 *  / \             / \
 * 2   3     ->    3   2          [2]
 *  \   \           \   \
 *   4   5           5   4        [3]
 *
 * Inorder traversal of left tree is 2 4 1 3 5 and of right tree is 3 5 1 2 4.
 * Swap operation: Given a tree and a integer, K,
 * we have to swap the subtrees of all the nodes who are at depth h, where h âˆˆ [K, 2K, 3K,...].
 *
 * You are given a tree of N nodes where nodes are indexed from [1..N] and it is rooted at 1.
 * You have to perform T swap operations on it,
 * and after each swap operation print the inorder traversal of the current state of the tree.
 *
 * Input Format
 * First line of input contains N, number of nodes in tree.
 * Then N lines follow. Here each of ith line (1 <= i <= N) contains two integers, a b,
 * where a is the index of left child, and b is the index of right child of ith node.
 * -1 is used to represent null node.
 * Next line contain an integer, T. Then again T lines follows. Each of these line contains an integer K.
 *
 * Output Format
 * For each K, perform swap operation as mentioned above and print the inorder traversal of the current state of tree.
 *
 * Constraints
 * 1 <= N <= 1024
 * 1 <= T <= 100
 * 1 <= K <= N
 * Either a = -1 or 2 <= a <= N
 * Either b = -1 or 2 <= b <= N
 * Index of (non-null) child will always be greater than that of parent.

 * Explanation
 * **[s] represents swap operation is done at this depth.
 * Test Case #00: As node 2 and 3 has no child, swapping will not have any effect on it. We only have to swap the child nodes of root node.
 *   1   [s]       1    [s]       1
 *  / \      ->   / \        ->  / \
 * 2   3 [s]     3   2  [s]     2   3
 *
 * Test Case #01: Swapping child nodes of node 2 and 3 we get
 *
 *   1                  1
 *  / \                / \
 * 2   3   [s]  ->    2   3
 * \    \            /   /
 * 4    5          4   5
 *
 * Test Case #02: Here we perform swap operations at the nodes whose depth is either 2 and 4 and then at nodes whose depth is 4.
 *          1                     1                          1
