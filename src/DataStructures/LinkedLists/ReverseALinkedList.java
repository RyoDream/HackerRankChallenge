/**
 * Reverse a linked list
 *
 * Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list.
 * Change the next pointers of the nodes so that their order is reversed.
 * The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.
 *
 * Input Format
 * You have to complete the Node* Reverse(Node* head) method which takes one argument - the head of the linked list.
 * You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.
 *
 * Output Format
 * Change the next pointers of the nodes that their order is reversed and return the head of the reversed linked list.
 * Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.
 *
 * Sample Input
 * NULL
 * 2 --> 3 --> NULL
 *
 * Sample Output
 * NULL
 * 3 --> 2 --> NULL
 *
 * Explanation
 * 1. Empty list remains empty
 * 2. List is reversed from 2,3 to 3,2
