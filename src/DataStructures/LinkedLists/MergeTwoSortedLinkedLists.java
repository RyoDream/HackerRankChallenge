package DataStructures.LinkedLists;

/**
 * Merge two sorted linked lists
 *
 * Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head nodes of two sorted linked lists.
 * The data in both lists will be sorted in ascending order.
 * Change the next pointers to obtain a single, merged linked list which also has data in ascending order.
 * Either head pointer given may be null meaning that the corresponding list is empty.
 *
 * Input Format
 * You have to complete the Node* MergeLists(Node* headA, Node* headB) method
 * which takes two arguments - the heads of the two sorted linked lists to merge.
 * You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.
 *
 * Output Format
 * Change the next pointer of individual nodes so that nodes from both lists are merged into a single list.
 * Then return the head of this merged list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.
 *
 * Sample Input
 * 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL
 * 2 -> 4 -> 7 -> NULL
 * 15 -> NULL
 * 12 -> NULL
 * NULL
 * 1 -> 2 -> NULL
 *
 * Sample Output
 * 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7
 * 12 -> 15 -> NULL
 * 1 -> 2 -> NULL
 *
 * Explanation
 * 1. We merge elements in both list in sorted order and output.
