/**
 * Java Comparator
 *
 * Comparators are used to compare two objects.
 * In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array.
 *
 * The Player class is provided for you in your editor.
 * It has 2 fields: a name String and a score integer.
 *
 * Given an array of n Player objects, write a comparator sorts them in order of decreasing score;
 * if 2 or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically by name.
 * To do this, you must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface,
 * then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2) method.
 *
 * Input Format
 * Input from stdin is handled by the locked stub code in the Solution class.
 * The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of players.
 * Each of the n subsequent lines contains a player's name and score, respectively.
 *
 * Constraints
 *      1. 0 <= score <= 1000
 *      2. 2players can have the same name.
 *      3. Player names consist of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * Output Format
 * You are not responsible for printing any output to stdout.
 * The locked stub code in Solution will create a Checker object,
 * use it to sort the Player array, and print each sorted element.
 *
 * Sample Input
 * 5
 * amy 100
 * david 100
 * heraldo 50
 * aakansha 75
 * aleksa 150
 *
 * Sample Output
 * aleksa 150
 * amy 100
 * david 100
 * aakansha 75
 * heraldo 50
