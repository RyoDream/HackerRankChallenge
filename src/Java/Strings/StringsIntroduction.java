/**
 * Java Strings Introduction
 *
 * "A string is traditionally a sequence of characters,
 * either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable." â€” Wikipedia: String (computer science)
 *
 * This exercise is to test your understanding of Java Strings.
 * A sample String declaration:
 * String myString = "Hello World!"
 *
 * The elements of a String are called characters.
 * The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.
 *
 *  Given two strings of lowercase English letters, A and B, perform the following operations:
 *
 * Sum the lengths of A and B.
 * Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does  come before  in the dictionary?).
 * Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
 *
 * Input Format
 * Two strings, the first being A and the second being B.
 * They are comprised of lowercase English letters (no symbols or spaces) and may not be on the same line.
 *
 * Output Format
 * There are three lines of output:
 * For the first line, sum the lengths of A and B.
 * For the second line, write Yes if A is lexicographically larger than B or No if it is not.
 * For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both  and  and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
 * Sample Input
 * hello
 * java
 *
 * Sample Output
 * 9
 * No
 * Hello Java
 *
 * Explanation
 * String  is "hello" and  is "java".
 * has a length of , and  has a length of ; the sum of their lengths is .
 * When sorted alphabetically/lexicographically, "hello" comes before "java"; therefore,  is not larger than  and the answer is No.
 * When you capitalize the first letter of both  and  and then print them separated by a space, you get "Hello Java".
